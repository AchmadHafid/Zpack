**Assalamu'alaikum brothers and sisters, peace be upon you!**

In this small library, I try to compile many kotlin snippet code (mostly extension funtions) regularly use in my project.
You can directly look into its source code to find some code that you may need or just add this lib into your build.

This library is compatible from API 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop) & AndroidX.

Add jitpack repository into your root build.gradle

```groovy
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    ...

}
```

Add the dependency

```groovy
dependencies {
  ...
  implementation 'com.github.AchmadHafid:Zpack:0.2.0'
